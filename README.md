## Description
Our project coordinates rideshares between a university campus and the airport. The goal is to help users quickly find reasonable matches tailored to their specific needs. This website is designed primarily for university students seeking a budget-friendly and more personalized method of finding rideshare companions. The platform will offer multiple features addressing both safety and logistical factors that riders must consider when choosing rides to share.
